# Summary
Solving systems of non-linear equations numerically is a common task in scientific modeling
work. Many software libraries have the capability to solve these kinds of systems, however, each
require slightly different forms of input. In addition, it is often important that the
user formulates the system in a manner which is suitable for the numerical algorithm. Finding an effective formulation is often an iterative process, which is facilitated if the system can be transformed symbolically.

*pyneqsys* offers a common interface to a handful of solvers. It furthermore provides tools to input and work with such systems symbolically. Having a symbolic representation
allows *pyneqsys* to automatically derive the Jacobian matrix, which is a task which is
laborious and a source of error when performed by hand. By relying on a computer algebra system,
*pyneqsys* allows the user to apply e.g. variable transformations or generate representations
in LaTeX, MathML etc. By default SymPy [@Meurer2017] is used as the symbolic back-end, but other libraries are also supported.

Adapting *pyneqsys* to use new third party solvers is straightforward and some example solvers are
provided with the library. Together with its ability to perform variable transformations symbolically
*pyneqsys* allows the users to write code for their problem *once* and then easily test different formulations and solvers. This greatly lowers the burden of validation and speeds-up the iterative finding of the best method for solving the problem.


# Features
- Unified interface to the KINSOL solver from SUNDIALS [@hindmarsh2005sundials],
  SciPy's solvers [@jones_scipy_2001], levmar [@lourakis04LM], NLEQ2 [@weimann1991family] and mpmath [@mpmath].
- Convenience methods for solving and plotting solutions as parameters of the system are varied.
- Automatic derivation of the Jacobian matrix.
- Symbolic variable transformations.
- Symbolic removal of linearly dependent equations by rewriting (linear parts) in reduced row echelon form.
- Carrying over the solution as initial guess in parameter variations.
- Facility for defining meta-algorithms (e.g. solve the system for one formulation first, and
  refine the solution by solving it as another formulation).
- Solve non-linear systems containing conditional equations (different equations governing different
  domains).
