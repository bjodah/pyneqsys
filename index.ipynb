    "This is a collection of demonstration notebooks for [pyneqsys](https://github.com/bjodah/pyneqsys). The pyneqsys package contains classes and functions for working with systems of nonlinear equations. Systems of non-linear equations can most often not be solved anayltically, but instead one have to use numerical methods to find solutions. ``pyneqsys`` provides facilities to manipulate systems of non-linear equations symbolically (and e.g. generate a latex representation of them), and it provides a unified interface to a collection of solvers from different numerical libraries. This is helps the end user to write the code definining the system *once*. \n",
